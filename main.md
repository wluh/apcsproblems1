Longitude is a number between -180 and 180

Write 5 methods:

- GetLat()
- GetLong()
- SetLat(double lat): If the input is invalid, set it to 0.
- SetLong(double long): If the input is invalid, set it to 0.
- DistanceTo(GPSLoc location)


## regular for loops

for (int x = 0; x < 100; x += 2) {
  System.out.println("Loop has iterated!");
}
```

## nested loops

## scope

##if statements

## 1d arrays
